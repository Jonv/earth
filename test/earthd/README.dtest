========= IMPORTANT NOTICE - READ THIS BEFORE RUNNING THE TEST ===========

This document briefly descibes the modifications and current status of the
dtest.rbscript which is a lean and less comprehensive version of the
original daemon_test.rb script.


TESTING NOTES (REQUIREMENTS)

1. Ensure that the test data inserted into the database during the execution
   of the unit tests are removed. The earth_test database should just be an 
   empty data container but with all the relevant tables and relationship 
   intact.

2. Create a test directory over which the testing script will be working on.
   Please ensure that you have write access to this directory and that it
   contains your data. The test script will DESTROY this directory when it
   is executed.

3. Testing of the caching feature in the daemon is monitored but not acted
   upon. Further investigation of the caching feature is required before
   this aspect of the test can be implemented.

4. This minimal version of the daemon_test.rb script was successfully tested
   on Revision 1180 of the Earth daemon (earthd). It will require some 
   modifications to run on future versions if the tested features have been
   modified in future version of the Earth daemon.


COMMANDS

1. Testing Over A Specified Number of Iterations

    ./dtest.rb -i nn /path_to_your_test_directory

    where nn = number of iterations


2. Testing Over A Long Period of Time (Real World Application)

    ./dtest.rb /path_to_your_test_directory


3. To Run Testing in Debug Mode

    Simply set the flag $debug_mode to true and re-execute the test script.


Note: The above commands are a subset of the acutal commands and testing 
      options that are available on the original test_daemon.rb test script.


SUCCESS CRITERIA

1. The following message should appear on the terminal to indicate succesful
   testing:

   ============= DAEMON TEST PASSED (No Assertion raised) =================

    Caching stats: 38/250    [15.2 % ]

   ========================================================================
