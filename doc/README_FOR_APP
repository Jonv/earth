Earth - it's really, really big

Earth allows you to find files across a large network of machines and
track disk usage in real time. It consists of a daemon that indexes
filesystems in real time and reports all the changes back to a central
database. This can then be queried through a simple web
interface. Think of it like Spotlight or Beagle but with a central
database for multiple machines.

Earth is initially focused on managing the explosion of data that
occurs in digital visual effects work.

Earth is being developed by Rising Sun Pictures (http://rsp.com.au)
and Mattthew Landauer from Visual Appliance
(http://www.visualappliance.com).

We don't yet have a release ready but if you would like to check out
the source code it is available via SVN by doing:

svn co https://seqspy.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/seqspy/trunk earth

Please submit any bug reports on the Earth Trac
(http://tools.assembla.com/earth) by adding a new ticket. Thanks for your
help!
